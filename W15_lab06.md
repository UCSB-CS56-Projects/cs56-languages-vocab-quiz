Concerns:
1. Need to find out how to get build.xml to read in file w/ list of words, so gui can be run from commant line.
2. Need to add more languages and allow file to read in other language - not hardcoding file to read in.
3. Come up with more features
   - add more graphics?
   - option to give hint?
4. How to add languages with non-English letters? i.e. Chinese
5. Add option of which language to give word from?
6. Split text files into different file for each language?
