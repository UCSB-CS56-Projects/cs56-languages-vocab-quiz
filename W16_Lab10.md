*Issue: the current GUI doesn't not iterate through the words in the text file, keeping the GUI stuck at a single word.

*Issue: The quiz.listNotEmpty(), which is used in the GUI and implemented in the VocabQuiz file may not be appropriately implemented to produce proper results in the GUI. For every ForeignVocabWord element, there should only be two words but a single element. So the iterator should countdown as such instead of checking if list is empty (would be easier to understand code)

*Issue: JWS still presents a FilePermissions issue, so this should be fixed to be able to fully run GUI on your device.

*Issue: MenuBar in GUI needs to implements. It does not have any actual functionality. Need to add ActionListeners to components.

*Issue: Multiple-Choice option would create an easier option for foreign language beginners

*Issue: FL -> English and English->FL option instead of simply having random words from either language be generated by ForeignVocabQuiz.java
