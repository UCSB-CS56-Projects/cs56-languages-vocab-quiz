A. This program is a foreign language quiz application that lets the user translate foreign words and practice with multiple languages.

B. As a player I can input english translations of the given words so that I can practice my translating skills.

   As a player, I can choose which language to translate so that I can practice in multiple languages.

C. The software runs, and a GUI is presented that lets you choose and language to translate from. It then displays a words for you to translate, with a given amount of chances. There are also several difficulty setting to choose from.

D. As a user, I can access the menu screen to help improve flow control and accessability.

   As a user, I can have a timer so that I can see how long it takes to give the correct answer.

E. Some extra information that could have been added is some tips for extra functions to add, or some warnings about certain elements or difficulties the previous group faced with this project.

F. This project is based on Ant. The targets are fairly self explanatory, although some more descriptions would have been helpful.

G. There are enough issues to earn 100 points, and the issues and fairly clear in terms of expectations.

H.

I. The code is organized into multiple .java files, with many subdirectories. The purposes of the classes and methods are fairly clear, but more comments would bee easier to work with. The code is a bit cluttered and could use some organizing and proper spacing. For another fellow programmer, we would decribe this project as one that reads txt files of multiple languages and takes user input from a created GUI while comparing it to the created answer. There are also various buttons on the UI that need to be fixed and worked on, as well as the overall display.

J. The test coverage is pretty poor for this project. There are JUnit tests, but there are only two test files with a handful of test cases. Also, there are a lot of GUI functionalities that have no test cases at all. We would say thatthe test coverage is about 20%. To expand the test coverage, we would write more test cases and edge cases for more of the functionalities and boundaries of the program, as well as test more scenarios.
