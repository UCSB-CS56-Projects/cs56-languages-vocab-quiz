a) This is a foreign language vocabulary quiz.

b) As I user, I can enter a word, to see if it is correct.

c) It does run. It presents a GUI that shows the quiz.

d)
   * As a user, I should be able to change the language after I selected the initial language.  
   * As a user, I should be able to change the known language (the current one is only language).  
   * As a user, I should be able to save scores to track progress over time.  
   * As a user, I should be able to save notes in a .txt file.
   
e) Update the picture. Remove everything in the Documentation section, and link it to the javadoc. More in depth explanation of the project.

f) build.xml file is okay. All targets have descriptions. We removed old legacy JWS stuff.

g) There are more than 1000 pts; issues are clear.

h) We have not yet added any additional issues. We may eventually add those in part (d).

i) The purposes of classes and their  methods are clear, due to good comments and method/class names. It is obvious how the classes relate to one another. The code is easy to read and understand. The class ForeignVocabQuizGUI processes things such as event source objcets, action listeners, and GUI widgets like labels and buttons. It also has a private ForeignVocabQuiz variable. The ForeignVocabQuiz manages the logic of the quiz. The ForeignVocabQuiz uses an instance of the FileRead class to read the vocab words from text files. The FileRead class manages the reading of the textfiles, and places each line of the text file as a String in an arraylist. The ForeignVocabWord class is a simple class that represents a vocab word. It contains properties that represent the english and foreign version of the word, getters and setters for those variables, and methods to check if a given foreign/english word equals a english/foreign word. The main class for running the application is in ForeignVocabQuizGUI, which creates an instance of ForeignVocabQuizGUI, and calls the method go() on the newly created instance. The go() method intiailizes and sets up all the GUI components. The ForeginVocabQuiz is created in the ForeginVocabQuizGUI.
